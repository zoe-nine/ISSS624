---

## Overview

Choropleth mapping involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colors. In this exercise, I will learn how to plot functional and truthful choropleth maps by using an R package called **tmap** package.

Two data set will be used to create the choropleth map. They are:

-   Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) (i.e. `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL`) in ESRI shapefile format. It can be downloaded at [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/).

-   Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2011-2020 in csv format (i.e. `respopagesextod2011to2020.csv`). This is an aspatial data fie. It can be downloaded at [Department of Statistics, Singapore](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/).

## Getting Started

Besides **tmap** package, four other R packages will be used:

-   [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) for importing delimited text file,

-   [**tidyr**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) for tidying data,

-   [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for wrangling data and

-   [**sf**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/) for handling geospatial data.

The code chunk below will be used to install and load these packages in RStudio.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tmap, tidyverse)
```

## Importing Data into R

### Importing Geospatial Data into R

The code chunk below uses the *st_read()* function of **sf** package to import `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL` shapefile into R as a simple feature data frame called `mpsz`.

```{r}
mpsz <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
mpsz
```

### Importing Attribute Data into R

Next, we will import *respopagsex2000to2018.csv* file into RStudio and save the file into an R dataframe called *popagsex* using *read_csv()* function of **readr** package as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r, message=FALSE}
popdata <- read_csv("data/aspatial/respopagesextod2011to2020.csv")
```

### Data Preparation

Before a thematic map can be prepared, you are required to prepare a data table with year 2020 values. The data table should include the variables PA, SZ, YOUNG, ECONOMY ACTIVE, AGED, TOTAL, DEPENDENCY.

-   YOUNG: age group 0 to 4 until age groyup 20 to 24,

-   ECONOMY ACTIVE: age group 25-29 until age group 60-64,

-   AGED: age group 65 and above,

-   TOTAL: all age group, and

-   DEPENDENCY: the ratio between young and aged against economy active group

#### Data wrangling

The following data wrangling and transformation functions will be used:

-   *pivot_wider()* of **tidyr** package, and

-   *mutate()*, *filter()*, *group_by()* and *select()* of **dplyr** package

```{r}
popdata2020 <- popdata %>%
  filter(Time == 2020) %>%
  group_by(PA, SZ, AG) %>%
  summarise(`POP` = sum(`Pop`)) %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=AG, 
              values_from=POP) %>%
  mutate(YOUNG = rowSums(.[3:6])
         +rowSums(.[12])) %>%
mutate(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` = rowSums(.[7:11])+
rowSums(.[13:15]))%>%
mutate(`AGED`=rowSums(.[16:21])) %>%
mutate(`TOTAL`=rowSums(.[3:21])) %>%  
mutate(`DEPENDENCY` = (`YOUNG` + `AGED`)
/`ECONOMY ACTIVE`) %>%
  select(`PA`, `SZ`, `YOUNG`, 
       `ECONOMY ACTIVE`, `AGED`, 
       `TOTAL`, `DEPENDENCY`)
```

#### Joining the attribute data and geospatial data

Before we can perform the georelational join, one extra step is required to convert the values in PA and SZ fields to uppercase. This is because the values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase. On the other, hand the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
popdata2020 <- popdata2020 %>%
  mutate_at(.vars = vars(PA, SZ), 
          .funs = funs(toupper)) %>%
  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` > 0)
```

Next, *left_join()* of **dplyr** is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. *SUBZONE_N* and *SZ* as the common identifier. *left_join()* of **dplyr** package is used with `mpsz` simple feature data frame as the left data table is to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame.

```{r}
mpsz_pop2020 <- left_join(mpsz, popdata2020,
                          by = c("SUBZONE_N" = "SZ"))
write_rds(mpsz_pop2020, "data/rds/mpszpop2020.rds")
```

## Choropleth Mapping Geospatial Data Using *tmap*

Two approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using *tmap*, they are:

-   Plotting a thematic map quickly by using *qtm()*.

-   Plotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.

### Plotting a choropleth map quickly by using *qtm()*

*qtm()* is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.

The code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below. *tmap_mode()* with "plot" option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, "view" option should be used. *fill* argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
qtm(mpsz_pop2020, 
    fill = "DEPENDENCY")
```

However, the aesthetics of individual layers using *qtm() is* harder to control.

### Creating a choropleth map by using *tmap*'s elements

To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, **tmap**'s drawing elements should be used.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY", 
          style = "quantile", 
          palette = "Blues",
          title = "Dependency ratio") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 0.35,
            frame = TRUE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_compass(type="8star", size = 2) +
  tm_scale_bar() +
  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +
  tm_credits("Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS", 
             position = c("left", "bottom"))
```

#### Drawing a base map

The basic building block of **tmap** is *tm_shape()* followed by one or more layer elemments such as *tm_fill()* and *tm_polygons()*.

In the code chunk below, *tm_shape()* is used to define the input data (i.e *mpsz_pop2020*) and *tm_polygons()* is used to draw the planning subzone polygons.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +
  tm_polygons()
```

#### Drawing a choropleth map using *tm_polygons()*

To draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we need to assign the target variable such as *Dependency* to *tm_polygons()*.

The default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called "pretty". The default colour scheme used is `YlOrRd` of ColorBrewer. By default, missing value will be shaded in grey.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_polygons("DEPENDENCY")
```

#### Drawing a choropleth map using *tm_fill()* and tm_border()

*tm_polygons()* is a wraper of *tm_fill()* and *tm_border()*. *tm_fill()* shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and *tm_borders()* adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.

The code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using *tm_fill()* alone.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY")
```

To add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below. The *alpha* argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1). Beside *alpha* argument, there are three other arguments for *tm_borders()*, they are:

-   *col* = border colour,

-   *lwd* = border line width. The default is 1, and

-   *lty* = border line type. The default is "solid".

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY") +
  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,  alpha = 1)
```

### Data classification methods of **tmap**

Most choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.

**tmap** provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: *fixed*, *sd*, *equal*, *pretty* (default), *quantile*, *kmeans*, *hclust*, *bclust*, *fisher*, and *jenks*.

To define a data classification method, the *style* argument of *tm_fill()* or *tm_polygons()* will be used.

#### Plotting choropleth maps with built-in classification methods

The code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          n = 5,
          style = "jenks") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

In the code chunk below, *equal* data classification method is used.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          n = 5,
          style = "equal") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

We could observe that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method

#### Plotting choropleth map with customed break

For all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the *breaks* argument to the *tm_fill()*. It is important to note that, in **tmap** the breaks include **a minimum and maximum**. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, ***n+1*** elements must be specified in the *breaks* option (the values must be in increasing order).

Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of **DEPENDENCY** field.

```{r}
summary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)
```

Now, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below to specify break points as well as maximum and minimum.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

### Colour Scheme

**tmap** supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the **RColorBrewer** package.

#### Using ColourBrewer palette

To change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to *palette* argument of *tm_fill()* as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          n = 6,
          style = "quantile",
          palette = "Blues") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

To reverse the colour shading, add a "-" prefix.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          style = "quantile",
          palette = "-Blues") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

### Map Layouts

Map layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohensive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, *the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios*.

#### Map Legend

In **tmap**, several *legend* options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY", 
          style = "jenks", 
          palette = "Blues", 
          legend.hist = TRUE, 
          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,
          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \n(Jenks classification)",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 0.35,
            legend.outside = FALSE,
            legend.position = c("right", "bottom"),
            frame = FALSE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

#### Map style

**tmap** allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed. They can be called by using *tmap_style()*. The code chunk below shows the *classic* style is used.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY", 
          style = "quantile", 
          palette = "-Greens") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tmap_style("classic")
```

#### Cartographic Furniture

Beside map style, **tmap** also also provides arguments to draw other map furniture such as compass, scale bar and grid lines. In the code chunk below, *tm_compass()*, *tm_scale_bar()* and *tm_grid()* are used to add compass, scale bar and grid lines onto the choropleth map.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY", 
          style = "quantile", 
          palette = "Blues",
          title = "No. of persons") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Distribution of Dependency Ratio \nby planning subzone",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 0.35,
            frame = TRUE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_compass(type="8star", size = 2) +
  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +
  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +
  tm_credits("Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS", 
             position = c("left", "bottom"))
```

To reset the default style, refer to the code chunk below.

```{r}
tmap_style("white")
```

### Drawing Small Multiple Choropleth Maps

**Small multiple maps**, also referred to as **facet maps**, are composed of many maps arrange side-by-side, and sometimes stacked vertically. Small multiple maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time. In **tmap**, small multiple maps can be plotted in three ways:

-   by assigning multiple values to at least one of the asthetic arguments,

-   by defining a group-by variable in *tm_facets()*, and

-   by creating multiple stand-alone maps with *tmap_arrange()*.

#### By assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments

In this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by defining ***ncols*** in **tm_fill().**

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill(c("YOUNG", "AGED"),
          style = "equal", 
          palette = "Blues",
          ncol = 2) +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("right", "bottom")) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tmap_style("white")
```

In this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments.

```{r}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ 
  tm_polygons(c("DEPENDENCY","AGED"),
          style = c("equal", "quantile"), 
          palette = list("Blues","Greens")) +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))
```

#### By defining a group-by variable in *tm_facets()*

In this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by using **tm_facets()**.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          style = "quantile",
          palette = "Blues",
          thres.poly = 0) + 
  tm_facets(by="REGION_N", 
            free.coords=TRUE, 
            drop.shapes=TRUE) +
  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,
            title.position = c("center", "center"), 
            title.size = 20) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

```

#### By creating multiple stand-alone maps with *tmap_arrange()*

In this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by creating multiple stand-alone maps with **tmap_arrange()**.

```{r}
youngmap <- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ 
  tm_polygons("YOUNG", 
              style = "quantile", 
              palette = "Blues")

agedmap <- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ 
  tm_polygons("AGED", 
              style = "quantile", 
              palette = "Blues")

tmap_arrange(youngmap, agedmap, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

### Mappping Spatial Object Meeting a Selection Criterion

Instead of creating small multiple choropleth map, you can also use **selection** funtion to map spatial objects meeting the *selection criterion*, in this case, the central region.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N=="CENTRAL REGION", ])+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY", 
          style = "quantile", 
          palette = "Blues", 
          legend.hist = TRUE, 
          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,
          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 5.0,
            legend.position = c("right", "bottom"),
            frame = FALSE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```
