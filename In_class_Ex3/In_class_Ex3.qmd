## Overview

In this hands-on exercise, I will gain hands-on experience on how to delineate homogeneous region by using geographically referenced multivariate data. There are two major analysis, namely:

-   hierarchical cluster analysis; and

-   spatially constrained cluster analysis.

## Getting Started

### The analytical question

In this hands-on exercise, I would delineate [Shan State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_State), [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar) into homogeneous regions by using multiple Information and Communication technology (ICT) measures, namely: Radio, Television, Land line phone, Mobile phone, Computer, and Internet at home.

Two data sets will be used in this study. They are:

-   Myanmar Township Boundary Data (i.e. *myanmar_township_boundaries*) : This is a GIS data in ESRI shapefile format. It consists of township boundary information of Myanmar. The spatial data are captured in polygon features.

-   *Shan-ICT.csv*: This is an extract of [**The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Myanmar**](https://myanmar.unfpa.org/en/publications/2014-population-and-housing-census-myanmar-data-sheet) at the township level.

Both data sets are download from [Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU)](http://themimu.info/)

### Installing and loading R packages

These are the packages required for this exercise:

-   Spatial data handling

    -   **sf**, **rgdal** and **spdep**

-   Attribute data handling

    -   **tidyverse**, especially **readr**, **ggplot2** and **dplyr**

-   Choropleth mapping

    -   **tmap**

-   Multivariate data visualisation and analysis

    -   **coorplot**, **ggpubr**, and **heatmaply**

-   Cluster analysis

    -   **cluster**

    -   **ClustGeo**

The code chunks below installs and launches these R packages into R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(rgdal, spdep, tmap, sf, ClustGeo, 
               ggpubr, cluster, factoextra, NbClust,
               heatmaply, corrplot, psych, tidyverse)
```

## Data Import and Prepatation

### Importing geospatial data into R environment

The code chunk below imports the Myanmar Township Boundary GIS data (ESRI shapefile) into R environment by using the [*st_read()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sf/versions/0.7-2/topics/st_read) function of **sf**.

```{r}
shan_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                   layer = "myanmar_township_boundaries") %>%
  filter(ST %in% c("Shan (East)", "Shan (North)", "Shan (South)"))
```

The imported township boundary object is called *shan_sf*. It is saved in **simple feature data.frame** format. The code chunk below views the content of the newly created *shan_sf* simple features data.frame.

```{r}
shan_sf
```

Since *shan_sf* is conformed to tidy framework, we can also *glimpse()* to reveal the data type of it's fields.

```{r}
glimpse(shan_sf)
```

### Importing aspatial data into R environment

The code chunk below imports the csv file using *read_csv* function of **readr** package.

```{r}
ict <- read_csv ("data/aspatial/Shan-ICT.csv")
```

The imported InfoComm variables are extracted from **The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Myanmar**. The attribute data set is called *ict*. It is saved in R's **tibble data.frame** format.

The code chunk below reveal the summary statistics of *ict* data.frame.

```{r}
summary(ict)
```

There are a total of eleven fields and 55 observation in the tibble data.frame.

### Derive new variables using **dplyr** package

The unit of measurement of the values are number of household. Using these values directly will be biased. In general, the townships with relatively higher total number of households will also have higher number of households owning radio, TV, etc. In order to overcome this problem, we will derive the penetration rate of each ICT variable by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
ict_derived <- ict %>%
  mutate(`RADIO_PR` = `Radio`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`TV_PR` = `Television`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`LLPHONE_PR` = `Land line phone`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`MPHONE_PR` = `Mobile phone`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`COMPUTER_PR` = `Computer`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  mutate(`INTERNET_PR` = `Internet at home`/`Total households`*1000) %>%
  rename(`DT_PCODE` =`District Pcode`,`DT`=`District Name`,
         `TS_PCODE`=`Township Pcode`, `TS`=`Township Name`,
         `TT_HOUSEHOLDS`=`Total households`,
         `RADIO`=`Radio`, `TV`=`Television`, 
         `LLPHONE`=`Land line phone`, `MPHONE`=`Mobile phone`,
         `COMPUTER`=`Computer`, `INTERNET`=`Internet at home`) 
```

The code chunk below reviews the summary statistics of the newly derived penetration rates.

```{r}
summary(ict_derived)
```

Notice that six new fields have been added into the data.frame. They are RADIO_PR, TV_PR, LLPHONE_PR, MPHONE_PR, COMPUTER_PR, and INTERNET_PR.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### EDA using statistical graphics

The code chunk below uses histogram to identify the overall distribution of the data values (i.e. left skew, right skew or normal distribution).

```{r}
ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
       aes(x=`RADIO`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")
```

Boxplot is useful to detect if there are outliers.

```{r}
ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
       aes(x=`RADIO`)) +
  geom_boxplot(color="black", 
               fill="light blue")
```

The code chunk below plots the distribution of the newly derived variables (i.e. Radio penetration rate).

```{r}
ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_boxplot(color="black", 
               fill="light blue")
```

The code chunk below plots multiple histograms to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the *ict_derived* data.frame.

First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.

```{r}
radio <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")

tv <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `TV_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")

llphone <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `LLPHONE_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")

mphone <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `MPHONE_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")

computer <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `COMPUTER_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")

internet <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `INTERNET_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")
```

Next, the [*ggarange()*](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggarrange.html) function of [**ggpubr**](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/) package is used to group these histograms together.

```{r}
ggarrange(radio, tv, llphone, mphone, computer, internet, 
          ncol = 3, 
          nrow = 2)
```

### EDA using choropleth map

#### Joining geospatial data with aspatial data

Before we can prepare the choropleth map, we need to combine both the geospatial data object (i.e. *shan_sf*) and aspatial data.frame object (i.e. *ict_derived*) into one. This will be performed by using the [*left_join*](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.tbl_df.html) function of **dplyr** package. The *shan_sf* simple feature data.frame will be used as the base data object and the *ict_derived* data.frame will be used as the join table.

The code chunks below is used to perform the task. The unique identifier used to join both data objects is *TS_PCODE*.

```{r}
shan_sf <- left_join(shan_sf, 
                     ict_derived, 
                     by=c("TS_PCODE"="TS_PCODE"))
```

The message above shows that *TS_CODE* field is the common field used to perform the left-join.

It is important to note that there is no new output data been created. Instead, the data fields from *ict_derived* data frame are now updated into the data frame of *shan_sf*.

#### Preparing a choropleth map

The code chunks below are used to prepare the choroplethby using the *qtm()* function of **tmap** package.

```{r}
qtm(shan_sf, "RADIO_PR")
```

In order to reveal the distribution shown in the choropleth map above are bias to the underlying total number of households at the townships, we will create two choropleth maps, one for the total number of households (i.e. TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map) and one for the total number of household with Radio (RADIO.map) by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map <- tm_shape(shan_sf) + 
  tm_fill(col = "TT_HOUSEHOLDS",
          n = 5,
          style = "jenks", 
          title = "Total households") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 

RADIO.map <- tm_shape(shan_sf) + 
  tm_fill(col = "RADIO",
          n = 5,
          style = "jenks",
          title = "Number Radio ") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 

tmap_arrange(TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map, RADIO.map,
             asp=NA, ncol=2)
```

Notice that the choropleth maps above clearly show that townships with relatively larger number ot households are also showing relatively higher number of radio ownership.

The code chunk below plots the choropleth maps showing the dsitribution of total number of households and Radio penetration rate.

```{r}
tm_shape(shan_sf) +
    tm_polygons(c("TT_HOUSEHOLDS", "RADIO_PR"),
                style="jenks") +
    tm_facets(sync = TRUE, ncol = 2) +
  tm_legend(legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))+
  tm_layout(outer.margins=0, asp=0)
```

## Correlation Analysis

Before we perform cluster analysis, it is important for us to ensure that the cluster variables are not highly correlated by using [*corrplot.mixed()*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/corrplot.pdf) function of [**corrplot**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html) package to visualise and analyse the correlation of the input variables.

```{r}
cluster_vars.cor = cor(ict_derived[,12:17])
corrplot.mixed(cluster_vars.cor,
         lower = "ellipse", 
               upper = "number",
               tl.pos = "lt",
               diag = "l",
               tl.col = "black")
```

The correlation plot above shows that COMPUTER_PR and INTERNET_PR are highly correlated. This suggest that only one of them should be used in the cluster analysis instead of both.

## Hierarchy Cluster Analysis

### Extracting clustering variables

The code chunk below will be used to extract the clustering variables from the *shan_sf* simple feature object into data.frame.

```{r}
cluster_vars <- shan_sf %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%
  select("TS.x", "RADIO_PR", "TV_PR", "LLPHONE_PR", "MPHONE_PR", "COMPUTER_PR")
head(cluster_vars,10)
```

Notice that the final clustering variables list does not include variable INTERNET_PR because it is highly correlated with variable COMPUTER_PR.

Next, the code chunk below changes the rows by township name instead of row number.

```{r}
row.names(cluster_vars) <- cluster_vars$"TS.x"
head(cluster_vars,10)
```

Now, we will delete the TS.x field by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
shan_ict <- select(cluster_vars, c(2:6))
head(shan_ict, 10)
```

### Data Standardisation

In order to avoid the cluster analysis result is biased to clustering variables with large values, it is useful to standardise the input variables before performing cluster analysis.

### Min-Max standardisation

In the code chunk below, *normalize()* of [*heatmaply*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heatmaply/) package is used to stadardisation the clustering variables by using Min-Max method. The *summary()* is then used to display the summary statistics of the standardised clustering variables.

```{r}
shan_ict.std <- normalize(shan_ict)
summary(shan_ict.std)
```

Notice that the values range of the Min-max standardised clustering variables are 0-1 now.

### Z-score standardisation

Z-score standardisation can be performed easily by using [*scale()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/scale) of Base R. The code chunk below will be used to stadardisation the clustering variables by using Z-score method.

```{r}
shan_ict.z <- scale(shan_ict)
describe(shan_ict.z)
```

Notice the mean and standard deviation of the Z-score standardised clustering variables are 0 and 1 respectively.

**Note:** [*describe()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Hmisc/versions/4.4-0/topics/describe) of [**psych**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/) package is used here instead of *summary()* of Base R because the earlier provides standard deviation.

***Warning: Z-score standardisation method should only be used if we would assume all variables come from some normal distribution.***

### Visualising the standardised clustering variables

Beside reviewing the summary statistics of the standardised clustering variables, it is also a good practice to visualise their distribution graphical.

The code chunk below plot the scaled *Radio_PR* field.

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
r <- ggplot(data=ict_derived, 
             aes(x= `RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue")

shan_ict_s_df <- as.data.frame(shan_ict.std)
s <- ggplot(data=shan_ict_s_df, 
       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue") +
  ggtitle("Min-Max Standardisation")

shan_ict_z_df <- as.data.frame(shan_ict.z)
z <- ggplot(data=shan_ict_z_df, 
       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 color="black", 
                 fill="light blue") +
  ggtitle("Z-score Standardisation")

ggarrange(r, s, z,
          ncol = 3,
          nrow = 1)
```

Notice that the overall distribution of the clustering variables will change after the data standardisation. Hence, it is advisible **NOT** to perform data standardisation if the values range of the clustering variables are not very large.

### Computing proximity matrix

The code chunk below computes the proximity matrix by using [*dist()*](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/dist.html) of R. *dist()* supports six distance proximity calculations, they are: **euclidean, maximum, manhattan, canberra, binary and minkowski**. The default is *euclidean* proximity matrix.

```{r}
proxmat <- dist(shan_ict, method = 'euclidean')
```

The code chunk below can then be used to list the content of *proxmat* for visual inspection.

```{r}
proxmat
```

### Computing hierarchical clustering

The code chunk below performs hierarchical cluster analysis using ward.D method. The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class **hclust** which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.

```{r}
hclust_ward <- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')
```

The code chunk below plots the tree by using *plot()* of R Graphics.

```{r}
plot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)
```

### Selecting the optimal clustering algorithm

One of the challenge in performing hierarchical clustering is to identify stronger clustering structures. The issue can be solved by using use [*agnes()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/cluster/versions/2.1.0/topics/agnes) function of [**cluster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/) package. The code chunk below will be used to compute the agglomerative coefficients of all hierarchical clustering algorithms.

```{r}
m <- c( "average", "single", "complete", "ward")
names(m) <- c( "average", "single", "complete", "ward")

ac <- function(x) {
  agnes(shan_ict, method = x)$ac
}

map_dbl(m, ac)
```

The output above shows that Ward's method provides the strongest clustering structure among the four methods assessed. Hence, in the subsequent analysis, only Ward's method will be used.

### Determining Optimal Clusters

Another technical challenge face by data analyst in performing clustering analysis is to determine the optimal clusters to retain.

There are [three](https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/determining-the-optimal-number-of-clusters-3-must-know-methods/) commonly used methods to determine the optimal clusters, they are:

-   [Elbow Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering))

-   [Average Silhouette Method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377042787901257?via%3Dihub)

-   [Gap Statistic Method](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~gwalther/gap)

#### Gap Statistic Method

The [**gap statistic**](http://www.web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/gap.pdf) compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data. The estimate of the optimal clusters will be value that maximize the gap statistic (i.e., that yields the largest gap statistic). To compute the gap statistic, [*clusGap()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/cluster/versions/2.1.0/topics/clusGap) of [**cluster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/) package will be used.

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
gap_stat <- clusGap(shan_ict, 
                    FUN = hcut, 
                    nstart = 25, 
                    K.max = 10, 
                    B = 50)
# Print the result
print(gap_stat, method = "firstmax")
```

Also note that the [*hcut*](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/factoextra/reference/hcut.html) function used is from [**factoextra**](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/factoextra/) package.

The code chunk below visualises the plot by using [*fviz_gap_stat()*](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/factoextra/reference/fviz_nbclust.html) of [**factoextra**](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/factoextra/) package.

```{r}
fviz_gap_stat(gap_stat)
```

With reference to the gap statistic graph above, the recommended number of cluster to retain is 1. However, it is not logical to retain only one cluster. By examine the gap statistic graph, the 6-cluster gives the largest gap statistic and should be the next best cluster to pick.

### Interpreting the dendrograms

In the dendrogram displayed above, each leaf corresponds to one observation. As we move up the tree, observations that are similar to each other are combined into branches, which are themselves fused at a higher height.

The height of the fusion, provided on the vertical axis, indicates the (dis)similarity between two observations. The higher the height of the fusion, the less similar the observations are. Note that, conclusions about the proximity of two observations can be drawn only based on the height where branches containing those two observations first are fused. We cannot use the proximity of two observations along the horizontal axis as a criteria of their similarity.

The code chunk below draws the dendrogram with a border around the selected clusters by using [*rect.hclust()*](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/rect.hclust.html) of R stats. The argument *border* is used to specify the border colors for the rectangles.

```{r}
plot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)
rect.hclust(hclust_ward, 
            k = 6, 
            border = 2:5)
```

### Visually-driven hierarchical clustering analysis

With **heatmaply**, we are able to build both highly interactive cluster heatmap or static cluster heatmap.

#### Transforming the data frame into a matrix

The data was loaded into a data frame, but it has to be a data matrix to make your heatmap.

The code chunk below will be used to transform *shan_ict* data frame into a data matrix.

```{r}
shan_ict_mat <- data.matrix(shan_ict)
```

#### Plotting interactive cluster heatmap using *heatmaply()*

In the code chunk below, the [*heatmaply()*](https://talgalili.github.io/heatmaply/reference/heatmaply.html) of [heatmaply](https://talgalili.github.io/heatmaply/) package is used to build an interactive cluster heatmap.

```{r}
heatmaply(normalize(shan_ict_mat),
          Colv=NA,
          dist_method = "euclidean",
          hclust_method = "ward.D",
          seriate = "OLO",
          colors = Blues,
          k_row = 6,
          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),
          fontsize_row = 4,
          fontsize_col = 5,
          main="Geographic Segmentation of Shan State by ICT indicators",
          xlab = "ICT Indicators",
          ylab = "Townships of Shan State"
          )
```

### Mapping the clusters formed

With closed examination of the dendragram above, I have decided to retain six clusters. [*cutree()*](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/cutree.html) of R Base will be used in the code chunk below to derive a 6-cluster model.

```{r}
groups <- as.factor(cutree(hclust_ward, k=6))
```

The output is called *groups*. It is a *list* object. In order to visualise the clusters, the *groups* object need to be appended onto *shan_sf* simple feature object.

The code chunk below form the join in three steps:

-   the *groups* list object will be converted into a matrix;

-   *cbind()* is used to append *groups* matrix onto shan_sf to produce an output simple feature object called `shan_sf_cluster`; and

-   *rename* of **dplyr** package is used to rename *as.matrix.groups* field as *CLUSTER*.

```{r}
shan_sf_cluster <- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %>%
  rename(`CLUSTER`=`as.matrix.groups.`)
```

Next, the code chunk belows uses *qtm()* of **tmap** package to plot the choropleth map showing the cluster formed.

```{r}
qtm(shan_sf_cluster, "CLUSTER")
```

The choropleth map above reveals the clusters are very fragmented. The is one of the major limitation when non-spatial clustering algorithm such as hierarchical cluster analysis method is used.

## Spatially Constrained Clustering - SKATER approach

This section teaches how to derive spatially constrained cluster by using [*skater()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/skater.html) method of [**spdep**](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/) package.

### Converting into SpatialPolygonsDataFrame

First, we need to convert `shan_sf` into SpatialPolygonsDataFrame. This is because SKATER function only support **sp** objects such as SpatialPolygonDataFrame. The code chunk below uses [*as_Spatial()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/coerce-methods.html) of **sf** package to convert *shan_sf* into a SpatialPolygonDataFrame called *shan_sp*.

```{r}
shan_sp <- as_Spatial(shan_sf)
```

### Computing Neighbour List

Next, [poly2nd()](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/poly2nb.html) of **spdep** package will be used to compute the neighbours list from polygon list.

```{r}
shan.nb <- poly2nb(shan_sp)
summary(shan.nb)
```

The code chunk below plost the neighbours list on shan_sp. The first plot command gives the boundaries. This is followed by the plot of the neighbor list object, with coordinates applied to the original SpatialPolygonDataFrame (Shan state township boundaries) to extract the centroids of the polygons. These are used as the nodes for the graph representation. The color is set to blue and the code specifies add=TRUE to plot the network on top of the boundaries.

```{r}
plot(shan_sp, 
     border=grey(.5))
plot(shan.nb, 
     coordinates(shan_sp), 
     col="blue", 
     add=TRUE)
```

Note that if you plot the network first and then the boundaries, some of the areas will be clipped. This is because the plotting area is determined by the characteristics of the first plot. In this example, because the boundary map extends further than the graph, we plot it first.

### Computing minimum spanning tree

#### Calculating edge costs

Next, [*nbcosts()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/nbcosts.html) of **spdep** package is used to compute the cost of each edge. It is the distance between it nodes. This function compute this distance using a data.frame with observations vector in each node.

The code chunk below is used to compute the cost of each edge.

```{r}
lcosts <- nbcosts(shan.nb, shan_ict)
```

For each observation, this gives the pairwise dissimilarity between its values on the five variables and the values for the neighbouring observation (from the neighbour list). Basically, this is the notion of a generalised weight for a spatial weights matrix.

Next, We will incorporate these costs into a weights object in the same way as we did in the calculation of inverse of distance weights. In other words, we convert the neighbour list to a list weights object by specifying the just computed ***lcosts*** as the weights. In order to achieve this, [*nb2listw()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/nb2listw.html) of **spdep** package is used as shown in the code chunk below. The *style* is set to **B** to make sure the cost values are not row-standardised.

```{r}
shan.w <- nb2listw(shan.nb, 
                   lcosts, 
                   style="B")
summary(shan.w)
```

### Computing minimum spanning tree

The minimum spanning tree is computed by mean of the [*mstree()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/mstree.html) of **spdep** package as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
shan.mst <- mstree(shan.w)
```

After computing the MST, the code chunk below checks its class and dimension.

```{r}
class(shan.mst)
```

The dimension is 54 and not 55 because the minimum spanning tree consists on n-1 edges (links) in order to traverse all the nodes.

The code chunk below displays the content of *shan.mst* by using *head()*.

```{r}
head(shan.mst)
```

The plot method for the MST includes a way to show the observation numbers of the nodes in addition to the edge. As before, the code chunk below plots this together with the township boundaries.

```{r}
plot(shan_sp, border=gray(.5))
plot.mst(shan.mst, 
         coordinates(shan_sp), 
         col="blue", 
         cex.lab=0.7, 
         cex.circles=0.005, 
         add=TRUE)
```

### Computing spatially constrained clusters using SKATER method

The code chunk below compute the spatially constrained cluster using [*skater()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/skater.html) of **spdep** package.

```{r}
clust6 <- skater(edges = shan.mst[,1:2], 
                 data = shan_ict, 
                 method = "euclidean", 
                 ncuts = 5)
```

The *skater()* takes three mandatory arguments: - the first two columns of the MST matrix (i.e. not the cost), - the data matrix (to update the costs as units are being grouped), and - the number of cuts. Note: It is set to **one less than the number of clusters**. So, the value specified is **not** the number of clusters, but the number of cuts in the graph, one less than the number of clusters.

The result of the *skater()* is an object of class **skater**. The code chunk below examines its contents.

```{r}
str(clust6)
```

The most interesting component of this list structure is the groups vector containing the labels of the cluster to which each observation belongs (as before, the label itself is arbitary). This is followed by a detailed summary for each of the clusters in the edges.groups list. Sum of squares measures are given as ssto for the total and ssw to show the effect of each of the cuts on the overall criterion.

The code chunk below checks the cluster assignment.

```{r}
ccs6 <- clust6$groups
ccs6
```

The code chunk below finds out how many observations are in each cluster by means of the table command.

```{r}
table(ccs6)
```

Lastly, the code chunk below plots the pruned tree that shows the five clusters on top of the townshop area.

```{r}
plot(shan_sp, border=gray(.5))
plot(clust6, 
     coordinates(shan_sp), 
     cex.lab=.7,
     groups.colors=c("red","green","blue", "brown", "pink"),
     cex.circles=0.005, 
     add=TRUE)
```

### Visualising the clusters in choropleth map

The code chunk below is used to plot the newly derived clusters by using SKATER method.

```{r}
groups_mat <- as.matrix(clust6$groups)
shan_sf_spatialcluster <- cbind(shan_sf_cluster, as.factor(groups_mat)) %>%
  rename(`SP_CLUSTER`=`as.factor.groups_mat.`)
qtm(shan_sf_spatialcluster, "SP_CLUSTER")
```

For easy comparison, it will be better to place both the hierarchical clustering and spatially constrained hierarchical clustering maps next to each other. This could be achieved by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
hclust.map <- qtm(shan_sf_cluster,
                  "CLUSTER") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 

shclust.map <- qtm(shan_sf_spatialcluster,
                   "SP_CLUSTER") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) 

tmap_arrange(hclust.map, shclust.map,
             asp=NA, ncol=2)
```

## Spatially Constrained Clustering: ClustGeo Method

In this section, I will use functions provided by **ClustGeo** package to perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical cluster analysis and spatially constrained cluster analysis.

### Ward-like hierarchical clustering: ClustGeo

ClustGeo package provides function called `hclustgeo()` to perform a typical Ward-like hierarchical clustering just like `hclust()`. To perform non-spatially constrained hierarchical clustering, we only need to provide the function a dissimilarity matrix as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
nongeo_cluster <- hclustgeo(proxmat)
plot(nongeo_cluster, cex = 0.5)
rect.hclust(nongeo_cluster, 
            k = 6, 
            border = 2:5)
```

Note that the dissimilarity matrix must be an object of class `dist`, i.e. an object obtained with the function `dist()`.

#### Mapping the clusters formed

Similarly, the code chunk below can plot the clusters on a categorical area shaded map.

```{r}
groups <- as.factor(cutree(nongeo_cluster, k=6))
shan_sf_ngeo_cluster <- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %>%
  rename(`CLUSTER` = `as.matrix.groups.`)
qtm(shan_sf_ngeo_cluster, "CLUSTER")
```

### Spatially Constrained Hierarchical Clustering

Before performing spatially constrained hierarchical clustering, a spatial distance matrix will be derived by using [`st_distance()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_measures.html) of sf package as shown in the code chunk below. `as.dist()` is used to convert the data frame into matrix.

```{r}
dist <- st_distance(shan_sf, shan_sf)
distmat <- as.dist(dist)
```

Next, `choicealpha()` will be used to determine a suitable value for the mixing parameter alpha as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
cr <- choicealpha(proxmat, distmat, range.alpha = seq(0, 1, 0.1), K=6, graph = TRUE)
```

With reference to the graphs above, alpha = 0.3 will be used as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
clustG <- hclustgeo(proxmat, distmat, alpha = 0.3)
```

Next, `cutree()` is used to derive the cluster object.

```{r}
groups <- as.factor(cutree(clustG, k=6))
```

The code chunk below then join back the group list with shan_sf polygon feature data frame.

```{r}
shan_sf_Gcluster <- cbind(shan_sf, as.matrix(groups)) %>%
  rename(`CLUSTER` = `as.matrix.groups.`)
```

The code chunk below plots the map of the newly delineated spatially constrained clusters.

```{r}
qtm(shan_sf_Gcluster, "CLUSTER")
```
